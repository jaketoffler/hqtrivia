This project was created for Brian Spiering's Natural Language Processing (NLP) course in cohort 6 of USF's MSDS (formerly MSAN) program.

The goal of this project is to create a script that can predict the answers to questions on the popular mobile trivia app, HQ Trivia. 

Running the Python script from the command line will return the accuracy for the current method on all questions transcribed by the Twitter user @HQTriviaScribe.  At the time of creation (6/28/18), this script takes over two hours to run on a Macbook Air, Early 2014 with 4GB of memory.  This is due to the time-intensive work of pulling many webpages and then parsing those webpages with BeautifulSoup.  For that reason, I have provided the dataframe from which the accuracy is calculated in this repository.  I have also provided a Jupyter notebook for a more interactive experience or if you would like to get predictions for a subset of the questions.  Note that you will need a set of Twitter API keys/secrets. 

Disclaimer: Although work still needs to be done in order for this to be able to be used during a live game, using this as a tool while playing the game breaks HQ Trivia's Terms of Service (https://hqtrivia.com/legal/rules.html): "entrants may not...benefit from...any technological means other than those explicitly provided by the Sponsor."
